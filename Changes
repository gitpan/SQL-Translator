2002-03-21 13:48  dlc

	changes

2002-03-21 12:52  dlc

	* Makefile.PL: Accidentally PREREQ_PM'ed XML::Writer instead fo
	XML::Dumper

2002-03-21 12:48  dlc

	* t/data/mysql/Apache-Session-MySQL.sql: Re-added

	* BUGS, TODO, t/01load.t, t/05bgep-re.t,
	t/data/mysql/Apache-Session-MySQL.sql: Added some basic files,
	removed unused data file (the contents were moved into the test
	that used the data).

2002-03-21 10:52  dlc

	* t/data/mysql/BGEP-RE-create.sql: Removed comment lines (the
	parser chokes on these, I think).  Changed DEFAULT x NOT NULL lines
	to NOT NULL DEFAULT x, so overcompensate for a bug in the MySQL
	parser.  Removed references to FULLTEXT indexes, because the MySQL
	grammar doesn't know about them.

2002-03-21 10:50  dlc

	* t/04file,fh,string.t: Removed warns and debugging, so this test
	will actually pass when run as part of make test.

2002-03-21 10:49  dlc

	* t/03mysql-to-oracle.t: Turned off SQL::Translator::DEBUG.

2002-03-21 10:49  dlc

	each one of which tests a specific part of the data structure
	returned by parse.

2002-03-21 10:48  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Producer/XML.pm: Changed name of translate
	method to produce, to be consistant with Producer API. Added
	__END__ token.	Updated $VERSION to be CPAN-compliant.

2002-03-21 10:47  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser.pm: Modified POD to include a complex
	description of the format of the data structure returned by parse. 
	Added myself to the AUTHORS section.

2002-03-21 10:45  dlc

	* Makefile.PL: Added Pod::Usage as a prerequisite

2002-03-19 08:26  dlc

2002-03-18 15:39  dlc

	* Changes: file Changes was initially added on branch darren-1_0.

2002-03-18 15:35  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Updated docs, especially detailed internal
	API docs.  Updated default sub to return the data structure (and
	not the SQL::Translator instance). This became an issue once the
	subs were redefined to accept two args.  Removed the possibility to
	pass a filehandle (or something that can getlines) as an option to
	translate.  Added many levels of code folding markers.	Updated
	parser to use a named class::function style of defining a function
	to call, just like producer.

2002-03-18 15:32  dlc

	* t/04file,fh,string.t: Changed many assumptions about the test. 
	Uses the default parser and producer (which is a pass through)

2002-03-18 15:30  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Producer/Oracle.pm: Added note of a bug

2002-03-15 15:18  dlc

	darren-1_0.

2002-03-15 15:13  dlc

	* lib/SQL/: Translator.pm, Translator/Parser.pm,
	Translator/Producer.pm, Translator/Parser/MySQL.pm,
	Translator/Producer/Oracle.pm: Added copyright notices to top of
	files.	Updated documentation to be accurate.  Updated parser and
	producer classes to work with the modified API defined by
	SQL::Translate.  SQL::Translator instances have data members named
	parser_type and producer_type that can be used to determine from
	whence the parser and producer subroutines come.  SQL::Translator
	will accept parsers and producers in the form
	Class::Name::function, just like mod_perl, in addition to
	Class::Name (with the implicit function name), Name (relative to
	SQL::Translator::{Parser,Producer}, and anonymous subroutines.

2002-03-15 15:10  dlc

	* t/: 02mysql-parser.t, 03mysql-to-oracle.t, 04file,fh,string.t,
	data/mysql/Apache-Session-MySQL.sql, data/mysql/BGEP-RE-create.sql:
	Added test data in groovy hierarchical directories.  Added some
	basic tests, many of which don't do much yet.

2002-03-07 09:11  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Reverted to a version 1.1, due to botched
	branch attempt.

2002-03-07 09:06  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Many, many changes.  Changed the basic
	assumptions about the module.  Parser and Producer packages no
	longer need to be object oriented, they merely need to implement a
	parse or translate function (respectively).
