Define structure of the data returned by parsers:
  o Producers need to know what to expect
  o For testing purposes, we need to know if parsers are returning
    something reasonable

Modules to be written/finished
    SQL::Translator::Validator
    SQL::Translator::Parser::xSV
    SQL::Translator::Producer::MySQL

Should the parsers return an instance instead of a data structure?  It
would make traversing the data structure easier.
